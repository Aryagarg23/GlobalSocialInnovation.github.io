# Navigate 1819 Innovation Hub

This project was created for the Global Social Innovation class (INTR3091) at the University of Cincinnati.

## Description

"Navigate 1819" is a web-based navigation tool designed to help first-time visitors and students navigate the University of Cincinnati's 1819 Innovation Hub. The project aims to address the challenges and intimidation visitors face when trying to find their way in unfamiliar campus buildings, which can discourage exploration and engagement.

## Our Mission

Our goal was to research and develop an innovative solution to the navigation challenges students face in new locations on campus. Using a human-centered design approach, we posed the question: "How might we address unfamiliarity with campus buildings such that first-time visitors have an easy time navigating and feeling connected to their destination?"

## The Team

* **Arya Garg** - Computer Science, 3rd Year
* **Akshaya Bala Subramani** - Computer Science, 2nd Year
* **Eliot Harned** - Media Production, 2nd Year
* **Noah Schumacher** - Computer Science, 3rd Year

## The Problem

Through interviews with students and observation of visitors at the 1819 Innovation Hub, we identified several key issues:

* Students often feel uncertain about their location without clear visual indicators.
* Asking a stranger for directions is often the most reliable method of navigation.
* Visitors often feel intimidated and have difficulty finding specific locations within the 1819 building.
* Negative experiences with navigation can discourage students from exploring new places on campus.

## Our Solution

To address these challenges, we developed a web-based, interactive navigation guide. The system provides a photo-based, step-by-step walkthrough of the 1819 building from the perspective of a person walking through the space. The guide features Arya, a virtual tour guide who replicates the experience of being escorted by a knowledgeable companion.

## Features

* **Interactive MVP:** A web-based application accessible via QR codes, eliminating the need to download a new app.
* **Virtual Tour Guide:** Arya guides users with a warm and welcoming demeanor, using hand signs and walking directions to make navigation more intuitive.
* **Step-by-Step Visuals:** The system uses a series of photos to guide users, enhancing orientation and reducing anxiety.
* **Floor-by-Floor Breakdown:** The home screen provides a clear overview of the locations on each floor.
* **QR Code Integration:** QR codes placed at the entrance allow for quick access to navigation for specific destinations.
* **Easy to Use:** Users can easily exit their current route and return to the home screen to explore other destinations.

## How to Use

The navigation guide is designed to be simple and intuitive. Visitors can scan a QR code at the entrance of the 1819 building to access the main navigation page or a direct route to a specific location.

## Future Development

We have identified several areas for future improvement:

* **Prototyping:** Incorporate suggestions from the 1819 team to better fit the use case.
* **System Integration:** Make the system work seamlessly with the 1819 building and student workers, and simplify the process of adding or removing locations.
* **Usability Testing:** Conduct more usability tests with first-time visitors to further refine the navigation process.
* **Graphic Design:** Improve the graphic design to align with the 1819 brand image, including making the QR codes less invasive to the decor.
* **Tour Guide:** In the future, the virtual tour guide could be the 1819 Bearcat mascot instead of Arya.
