# Navigate 1819 Innovation Hub

This project was created for the Global Social Innovation class (INTR3091) at the University of Cincinnati.

## Description

[cite_start]"Navigate 1819" is a web-based navigation tool designed to help first-time visitors and students navigate the University of Cincinnati's 1819 Innovation Hub. [cite: 1] [cite_start]The project aims to address the challenges and intimidation visitors face when trying to find their way in unfamiliar campus buildings, which can discourage exploration and engagement. [cite: 3, 4]

## Our Mission

[cite_start]Our goal was to research and develop an innovative solution to the navigation challenges students face in new locations on campus. [cite: 5] [cite_start]Using a human-centered design approach, we posed the question: "How might we address unfamiliarity with campus buildings such that first-time visitors have an easy time navigating and feeling connected to their destination?" [cite: 6, 7]

## The Team

* [cite_start]**Arya Garg** - Computer Science, 3rd Year [cite: 2]
* [cite_start]**Akshaya Bala Subramani** - Computer Science, 2nd Year [cite: 2]
* [cite_start]**Eliot Harned** - Media Production, 2nd Year [cite: 2]
* [cite_start]**Noah Schumacher** - Computer Science, 3rd Year [cite: 2]

## The Problem

[cite_start]Through interviews with students and observation of visitors at the 1819 Innovation Hub, we identified several key issues: [cite: 3, 4, 9]

* [cite_start]Students often feel uncertain about their location without clear visual indicators. [cite: 10]
* [cite_start]Asking a stranger for directions is often the most reliable method of navigation. [cite: 10]
* [cite_start]Visitors often feel intimidated and have difficulty finding specific locations within the 1819 building. [cite: 4]
* [cite_start]Negative experiences with navigation can discourage students from exploring new places on campus. [cite: 3]

## Our Solution

To address these challenges, we developed a web-based, interactive navigation guide. [cite_start]The system provides a photo-based, step-by-step walkthrough of the 1819 building from the perspective of a person walking through the space. [cite: 19] [cite_start]The guide features Arya, a virtual tour guide who replicates the experience of being escorted by a knowledgeable companion. [cite: 18]

## Features

* [cite_start]**Interactive MVP:** A web-based application accessible via QR codes, eliminating the need to download a new app. [cite: 23]
* [cite_start]**Virtual Tour Guide:** Arya guides users with a warm and welcoming demeanor, using hand signs and walking directions to make navigation more intuitive. [cite: 25, 26, 27]
* [cite_start]**Step-by-Step Visuals:** The system uses a series of photos to guide users, enhancing orientation and reducing anxiety. [cite: 19]
* [cite_start]**Floor-by-Floor Breakdown:** The home screen provides a clear overview of the locations on each floor. [cite: 15]
* [cite_start]**QR Code Integration:** QR codes placed at the entrance allow for quick access to navigation for specific destinations. [cite: 16]
* [cite_start]**Easy to Use:** Users can easily exit their current route and return to the home screen to explore other destinations. [cite: 17]

## How to Use

The navigation guide is designed to be simple and intuitive. [cite_start]Visitors can scan a QR code at the entrance of the 1819 building to access the main navigation page or a direct route to a specific location. [cite: 16, 23]

## Future Development

[cite_start]We have identified several areas for future improvement: [cite: 29]

* [cite_start]**Prototyping:** Incorporate suggestions from the 1819 team to better fit the use case. [cite: 29]
* [cite_start]**System Integration:** Make the system work seamlessly with the 1819 building and student workers, and simplify the process of adding or removing locations. [cite: 30]
* [cite_start]**Usability Testing:** Conduct more usability tests with first-time visitors to further refine the navigation process. [cite: 31]
* [cite_start]**Graphic Design:** Improve the graphic design to align with the 1819 brand image, including making the QR codes less invasive to the decor. [cite: 32]
* [cite_start]**Tour Guide:** In the future, the virtual tour guide could be the 1819 Bearcat mascot instead of Arya. [cite: 28]
